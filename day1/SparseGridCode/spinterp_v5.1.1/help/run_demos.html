         <p>In the following, we provide the output of the provided demo programs of the software as a reference. The results shown here
            were computed using MATLAB Version 7.0 (R14SP2) running on a Linux version 2.4.27 workstation equipped with one Intel Pentium
            4 CPU 3.2 GHz Processor and 2 GB of memory.
